# Detection-of-Covid-19-and-Pneumonia-Through-Chest-X-Ray-Image-Using-Deep-Learning

# Details
This project is build by myself in python using deep Learning and CNN concepts. This Project is GUI based Desktop Application. It is quite simple to use. It accepts Chest X-ray image from the user and differentiate wether the patient has Covid-19 OR Pneumonia. This project Consist of Regex validation applied pateint details entries. The GUI is made by using Tkinter Library. The backend is made by using tensroflow and keras.

The CNN model has a accuracy of 97%. The data figures are Covid-19 images=2600, Pneumonia images=3100, Normal images=6200.

# Flow of the Project
. Enter details of Patient in field (Regex validation applied on all feilds)
. All the details will be saved in a csv file at the project directory

. Select the image and Test the image
. A report with patient details will be generated with the test results
